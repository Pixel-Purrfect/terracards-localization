# Terracards Localization 🐮🌎
Welcome to the official Terracards localization repository! Feel free to suggest, add, or remove content from the game's localization file.


## Why? 🤔
We aim to offer the game in as many languages as possible. Currently, we're using AI for translation (excluding English, Portuguese, and 80% of French), but this approach doesn't always yield the most desirable results. Many players have expressed concerns about phrases that don't make sense in their language, and we want to improve clarity for everyone.

## Rules 😒
Before contributing, please keep in mind the following points:
1. We won't explain how to use Git and GitHub. It's pretty straightforward — fork it and make a pull request. I'm confident you can find the Git commands on Google!
2. Communication, questions, and answers are exclusively in English or Portuguese.
3. Try to follow this pattern in commit messages: `add/fix/remove: your message goes here`


## Languages 🗣
You may notice that `localization.csv` has entries for every single language. We acknowledge that this isn't the best approach, and we plan to improve it soon.
