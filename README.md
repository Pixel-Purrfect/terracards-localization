# Terracards Localization 🐮🌎
Welcome to the official Terracards localization repository! You may suggest, add or remove content to the game's localization file.


## Why? 🤔
Well, we want to provide the maximum number possible of languages to the game. Currently we're using AI to translate everything (except English, Portuguese and 80% of French), which doesn't give us the most desirable result. A lot of players complains about phrases that doesn't make any sense in their language and we do want to make it clearer for them.

## Rules 😒
Before contributing, please keep in mind those points:
1. We won't explain you how to use Git and GitHub. Pretty straight forward, fork it and make pull request. _I'm pretty sure you can Google the Git commands!_
2. Communication, questions and answers are exclusively in English or Portuguese.
3. Try to follow this pattern on commit messages: `add/fix/remove: your message goes here`


## Languages 🗣
You may notice that `localization.csv` has entries for every single language. We know this isn't the best way of doing it and we'll make it better soon.
